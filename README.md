# Final Project Topic 
Predicting Customer Retention Strategies Using Telco Customer Churn Dataset

# Project Definition: 
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies customers who are most likely to stay with Telco. It looks at various attributes, such as customer demographics, service usage, and payment history to do so. The dataset that will be used for this project is on Kaggle and provides data that can be used to predict customer behavior to analyze customer retention. The goal is to use this data to come up with customer retention strategies to maintain valuable customers based on current behavior.

# Dataset: 
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at this website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data
